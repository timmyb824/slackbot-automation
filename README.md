## Summary

A very basic set of automation scripts that provisons AWS resources (e.g. EC2) with Terraform and then configures them using Ansible. I created this to quickly get my slackbot up and running on an EC2 instance. I inteneded to improve and expand this automation but have been side tracked with other work.

## Dependicies

The scripts rely on Terraform and Ansible. There are many ways to install these depending on your OS. A simple google search should show you the way.
